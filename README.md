# CMOS(Closed-Managed-Open-Source) Community Guideline

Guidelines for a project where the project is technically closed-source but have
contributors.

## Leadership Tracks

There are two typical setups of an org involved in collaborative technical projects.

1. Technically-able management

In this kind of organization, leaders/management have adept technical skills, and have the capacity to personally lead each feature/epic to fruition. Typically the Community Tech Leader will build the foundation and specify what are the key areas to invest time on and act as 
deeply commited stakeholders.

2. Non-technical management 

For many communities, this is the common scenario. The leaders have outsourced the code and technology to a friendly 3rd-party. The 3rd-party provider usually is the one being asked to develop  features needed and have commited to do so. Usually, they let the technical folks do their thing while giving an alloted budget or simply exposure.


## Management style based on track

Agile focuses on deeply commited stakeholders and the community giving feedback on whats possible. For non-technical leaders, they need explanations and simplifications of the things that devs are going to build.  Usually non-technical management would just "let it go" and expect something in return in regular time frames.

For orgs with a good grasp on technology projects, a leader would push the direction of the development or assign the friendly tech guy to take initiative on it.

This guideline is more for the latter type which is usually for tech-oriented orgs or those that organize tech meetups.


## To scrum or not to scrum

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) states:

> * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> * Working software over comprehensive documentation
> * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> * Responding to change over following a plan

As long as these principles are followed, I think the decision to use scrum or not is dependent on how commited the dev team is. The dev team (including BA and QA) should set the pace of the project.

## Proposing new ideas

Just like in any professional work, there should be established or clearly set guidelines on how things should be put live. There are various types of requests that are usually on the [backlog](https://www.smartsheet.com/ultimate-agile-dictionary#backlog). But first, let's talk about how do we add to the backlog.

In Agile, _anyone_ can add to the backlog. However this differs in an organizatio, where usually a leader would be the one to add to the backlog. 

Backlog items should be communicated to the team regularly. New backlog items should be estimated, and then prioritized and finally given to someone who will take care of it

## Sharing new features

Devs should show the work they've done either in a POC or as actual code on ideally staging environment.

## Working agreements

Teams should discuss when they are available, what they are going to do for the following periods.

## Devops

There should be a discussion on the processes in place to do [CI/CD](https://semaphoreci.com/cicd). 

## Design Process

Scrum/Dev Teams should know be familiar basics to set the design direction  - tone and wording, terminology, design layouts and overall look-and-feel. If this is not done, people will create their solutions in whatever way possible and leads to a [bad User Experience](https://usabilitygeek.com/10-characteristics-bad-user-experience/) due to [UI inconsitencies](https://uxplanet.org/7-deadly-ux-sins-and-how-to-avoid-them-f47292e1f5dd)).
